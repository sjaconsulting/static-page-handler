/**
 * Cloudflare Worker Script for Serving Static Files from R2 Based on Hostname and Path
 *
 * Description:
 * This Worker script handles HTTP requests to serve static files stored in a Cloudflare R2 bucket.
 * It maps incoming requests to specific file paths within the R2 bucket based on the request's
 * hostname and pathname. This allows for serving static content on multiple domains using a
 * single Worker and R2 bucket, with a structured directory setup in R2 to separate files by hostname.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Supports multiple hostnames with custom paths for static files.
 * - Uses a directory structure in R2 to organize files per hostname.
 * - Handles GET, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods.
 * - Authorization for PUT and DELETE methods using a pre-shared secret.
 * - Allow list for GET requests to restrict accessible paths.
 *
 * Configuration:
 * - HOST_PATH_MAP: Object mapping hostnames to their respective path-to-file mappings.
 * - ALLOW_LIST: Array of paths allowed for GET requests without authorization.
 * - STATIC_PAGE_HANDLER_AUTH_KEY_SECRET: Environment variable storing the pre-shared secret for authorization.
 * - MY_BUCKET: Binding to the Cloudflare R2 bucket where files are stored.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Deploy this script as a Cloudflare Worker.
 * - Set up environment variables and bindings (STATIC_PAGE_HANDLER_AUTH_KEY_SECRET and MY_BUCKET).
 * - Define hostnames and path mappings in HOST_PATH_MAP.
 * - Add allowed paths to ALLOW_LIST for GET requests.
 *
 * Security:
 * - PUT and DELETE requests require the "X-Custom-Auth-Key" header matching STATIC_PAGE_HANDLER_AUTH_KEY_SECRET.
 * - GET requests are restricted to paths specified in ALLOW_LIST.
 * - Only mapped hostnames and paths are served; others return a 404 Not Found.
